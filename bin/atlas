#!/bin/sh

# This is a wrapper CLI around the Atlas.js CLI utility. Its sole purpose is to prepare the runtime
# for local development by:
#
# - compiling all sources
# - providing an opportunity to load dotenv/config while running locally
# - otherwise modify the runtime in any way or perform other tasks which are only relevant on local
#   development (ie. start some docker containers with database etc.)
#
# ‚ö†Ô∏è This CLI should NOT be used on actual deployments - to start Atlas.js there, just run the Atlas
# CLI utility directly: node_modules/.bin/atlas start

# Ie., to load a module on startup, you can do the following:
# export NODE_OPTIONS="--trace-deprecation --trace-warnings --require dotenv/config"

# Compile all JavaScripts
make compile

export NODE_OPTIONS="--require dotenv/config"

# Release the Kraken! üêô
exec "$(pwd)/node_modules/.bin/atlas" "$@"
