# Application-specific services

This is the best place to create custom, business-specific services.

Generally, it is better to have all services in the _src/components_ directory so that it can be easily shared among other projects but if you have a service which is so specific to your project that it is unlikely to ever be useful somewhere else it is perfectly fine to place it here.
